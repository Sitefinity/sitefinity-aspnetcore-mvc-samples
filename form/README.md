# Form data sample
This sample demonstrates how to post form data to a standard MVC controller. There are no Sitefinity specific customizations in this sample, it just serves as an example on how this functionality can be achieved.

In this example we have a widget(ViewComponent) that has a form inside it. It will post this form data to an MVC controller which then shows a greeting message.
