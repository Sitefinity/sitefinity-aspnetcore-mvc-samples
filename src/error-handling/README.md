# Error pages

Shows integration between ASP.NET Core error pages middleware and status code middleware for integration with the 
Sitefinity .NET Core renderer. The implementation itself has no customizations and adheres to the official [MS docs]() on handling error pages.

The example uses RazorPages to show the custom error pages with their original status code.
